Code Model:

The Code model represents a structured entity that encapsulates properties and behaviors related to code. Although it's not explicitly defined as a class, it serves as a blueprint for creating instances with properties like text, userId, title, ipAddress, and vscode.
Function Abstraction:

Each exported function (createCode, getCode, getSingleCode, createCodeWithVSCode, getCodeWithVSCode) represents a set of operations related to the Code entity. These functions encapsulate specific functionalities and can be seen as methods that act on instances of the Code entity.
Encapsulation:

The functions and the Code model encapsulate their specific logic. For example, the createCode function encapsulates the logic for creating a new code instance and saving it to the database.
Error Handling:

Error handling is localized within each function, encapsulating the logic for dealing with errors related to the specific operation.
Reusability:

Some functionality, such as code creation, retrieval, and deletion, is reused across different functions, promoting a degree of code reusability.
Consistency and Maintainability:

The code follows consistent patterns for interacting with the Code model, enhancing maintainability. For instance, similar error response structures are used across functions.
Separation of Concerns:

Each function has a distinct responsibility, such as creating code, retrieving code, or handling code with VSCode. This aligns with the separation of concerns principle.
Scheduling Deletion:

The scheduleDeletion function demonstrates a scheduling mechanism using the node-schedule library. Although not a classical OOP concept, the idea of scheduling a deletion operation encapsulates a specific behavior related to code instances.
