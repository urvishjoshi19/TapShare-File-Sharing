In the provided code, object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts are used through the implementation of a class (File) to encapsulate related properties and methods. Let's break down how OOP is applied in this example:

Class Definition (File):


class File {
  constructor(fileName, fileSize, fileType) {
    this.fileName = fileName;
    this.fileSize = fileSize;
    this.fileType = fileType;
    this.uploadDate = new Date();
  }

  getFileDetails() {
    return {
      fileName: this.fileName,
      fileSize: this.fileSize,
      fileType: this.fileType,
      uploadDate: this.uploadDate,
    };
  }
}
Constructor Method: The constructor method is like a special method that gets called when a new instance of the class is created (new File(...)). It initializes the properties of the instance (fileName, fileSize, fileType, uploadDate).
Method (getFileDetails): The getFileDetails method is a function associated with instances of the class. It returns an object containing details about the file.
Schema Definition (fileSchema):

Copy code
const fileSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  fileName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  fileSize: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
  },
  fileType: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  uploadDate: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
});
The fileSchema object defines the structure of the data that will be stored in the MongoDB database.
It uses OOP principles by organizing related properties (fileName, fileSize, fileType, uploadDate) into a schema, which is akin to a blueprint.
Model Creation (FileModel):

const FileModel = mongoose.model('File', fileSchema);
The FileModel is created using mongoose.model, associating the fileSchema with a model name ('File').
This model is what interacts with the MongoDB database and represents a collection of documents with properties specified in the schema.
Exporting the Class and Model:


module.exports = { File, FileModel };

The class (File) and the model (FileModel) are exported to make them accessible in other files.
This encapsulation allows other parts of the application to use the File class for creating file instances and the FileModel for interacting with the database.
By using a class (File), this code employs the principles of encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity, which are fundamental to object-oriented programming.
