Class Definition:

The code defines a class named Email. A class is a blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior related to sending emails.
Constructor:

The class has a constructor method, which is called when an instance of the class is created. The constructor initializes the properties of the class (transporter and from) with the provided parameters (user, pass, and from).
Encapsulation:

The class encapsulates the functionality related to sending emails. All the email-related logic, such as creating a transporter and sending emails, is contained within the class.
Initialization and State:

The transporter and from properties are initialized during the creation of an instance of the Email class. These properties represent the state of an email object.
Method Definition:

The class defines a method named sendEmail that encapsulates the process of sending an email. It takes parameters such as the recipient's email address (to), the email subject (subject), and the email body text (text).
Asynchronous Behavior:

The sendEmail method is asynchronous and uses the async/await syntax. This allows for non-blocking behavior when sending emails, ensuring that the application remains responsive.
Error Handling:

The code includes error handling within the sendEmail method. If an error occurs during the email sending process, it is caught, logged, and rethrown as an error with a descriptive message.
Exporting the Class:

The class is exported as a module, making it available for use in other parts of the application. This supports the idea of modularity and code reuse.
